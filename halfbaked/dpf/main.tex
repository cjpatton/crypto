\begin{abstract}
  The point function of binary strings~$X$ and~ $Y$ is defined by $P_{X,Y}(X) =
  Y$ and $P_{X,Y}(X^\prime) = 0^{|Y|}$ for all $X^\prime \ne X$. A distributed
  point function (DPF) scheme maps~$P_{X,Y}$ to a sequence of shares which, when
  combined, yield the point function, but from a subset of which neither~$X$
  nor~$Y$ can be recovered. This primitive was first suggested in the context of
  private information retrieval where the goal is to allow clients to \emph{read
  from} a database distributed among a set of servers without revealing which
  data were read. It was recently proposed as a way to address traffic analysis
  attacks in the context of anonymous communication.
  %
  The goal of the Riposte cryptosystem \cite{riposte} is to allow clients to
  \emph{write to} a distributed database without revealing to the servers which
  data were written. However, by sending the servers mal-formed shares, a
  malicious client or network adversary can easily corrupt the database state.
  As pointed out by the designers, it is crucial in this setting that the
  servers be able to verify their shares are correct.
